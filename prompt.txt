I need thirty-two news headlines regarding Blue Valley to be released ASAP. These thirty-two news headlines need to cover all important aspects surrounding Blue Valley (finance, oligarch, socio-politics, technology, and climate change). Each of these headlines shall have its sentiment embedded along with it, therefore, always write each headlines in a javascript object like so:

{ headline: "First COVID-19 death recorded in Blue Valley since 2021.", isPositive: false }
